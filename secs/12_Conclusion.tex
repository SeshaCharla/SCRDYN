\section{Conclusion}
This work developed a uniquely identifiable parametric nonlinear model structure for SCR-ASC dynamics based on the first principles. The corss-validation results show the goodness of fit for the model. The parameters are not distinct with respect to the aging of the catalyst. The parametric structure is unique while the actual parameter and regression vectors can be tweaked based on models for rate constants, residence time and urea injection. This allows us to choose appropriate assumptions for the reduced order model for the process.
