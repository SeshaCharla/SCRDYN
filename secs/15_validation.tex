\section{Model Validation: Simulation Results}

The full nonlinear hybrid model is simulated with the initial conditions alone and the inputs ($u_1, u_2, F$ and $T$). The switching condition is not currently clear but assuming the goal of controller is to maximize the performance of the catalyst, the guard condition for switching to the saturated model is chosen to be the maximum $NO_x$ reduction among the saturated and desaturated model. The hybrid automata for the system presented in the figure~\ref{fig::hybrid_automata}.
