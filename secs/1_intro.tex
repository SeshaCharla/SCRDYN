\section{Introduction}

Diesel engine after-treatment systems are engineered to diminish the emission of
harmful gases such as $NO_x$ and $CO$ from exhaust gases. The SCR-ASC system
chemically converts $NO_x$ into $N_2$ and $H_2O$, utilizing ammonia as a reducing agent
in the presence of a catalyst. This catalytic conversion process is regulated to
decrease the levels of ammonia in the exhaust, known as Ammonia Slip, through
two methods. The first is feedback control, which adjusts the urea injection
rate based on the exhaust $NO_x$ concentrations. The second method involves an
additional catalytic reaction, the ASC (Ammonia Slip Catalysis), which is
designed to oxidize any excess ammonia at the end of the SCR bed.
Figure~\ref{fig:exhaust_scheme} shows a schematic of the SCR system. The
catalyst aging is a critical issue in the SCR-ASC system, as it can lead to
reduction in the efficacy of conversion and increased ammonia slip. A
fault detection system that can detect the aging of the catalyst would provide
better control over the maintenance of the system and improve the overall
reduction in emissions.

Thus, modern diesel after-treatment systems, particularly those that integrate Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) with
Ammonia Slip Catalyst (ASC), necessitate advanced on-board diagnostics (OBD) tools for accurate assessment of SCR
degradation levels. However, the effectiveness of traditional OBD approaches for this purpose has been impeded by the
absence of model validation with real-world catalyst degradation data and the limitations imposed by existing commercial
$NO_x$ sensors' cross-sensitivity to ammonia.

Numerous studies have been conducted on modeling the SCR-ASC systems and their control (\cite{yuan2015diesel}). A
prevalent modeling approach is to approximate the PDE model from the plug flow reactor assumption into a set of ODEs
using the idealization of the plug-flow reactor into a sequence of CSTRs (\cite{hsieh2011development}, and
\cite{nova2014urea}). This discretization requires at least 2 CSTRs to capture the system dynamics and causality,
thereby increasing the model order. Moreover, the reactions considered are generally confined to selected SCR and ASC
reactions. The single CSTR approach was first justified in \cite{devarakonda2008adequacy} and a nonlinear model was
developed using these assumptions, which was then linearized for feedback control design (\cite{devarakonda2009model}).
With this model, observers were designed to estimate the states corresponding to the catalyst's storage
(\cite{ma2017observer}, \cite{jain2020term}). A method for detecting the catalyst's aging by observing the change in the
maximum storage capacity of the catalyst, modeled as an exponential function of temperature, was also proposed in
\cite{ma2017observer}. A common theme in these studies is the resulting non-convex, nonlinear parameter estimation
problem. Moreover, these studies assume the availability of all the gaseous states at the tail-pipe to eliminate the
effects of cross-sensitivity of the $NO_x$ sensors, which is not always the case in real-world applications. One other
fundamental issue with a single cell CSTR assumption is that it results in the causality reversal at the reaction rates
as CSTR inherently assumes that the output concentrations are the same as CSTR's accumulator concentrations.


The existing models for control and estimation of diesel-engine SCR-ASC dynamics spur the need for a "low-order",
"high-fidelity" model capable of diagnostics.

One of the fundamental assumptions in the diesel engine SCR-ASC modelling, CSTR, reverts the causality in the reaction
rate constants, when the model order is reduced by considering a single cell. The present work circumvents the problem
by discarding the CSTR assumption and modelling the time evolution of the sensor signals when a "plug" or "parcel" of
the exhaust gasses flows through the chamber.

Such a time evolution introduces constraints on the model due to sampling limitations. To capture the transient
dynamics, the sampling time should be significantly smaller than the "residence time" of the reactants inside the
SCR-ASC chamber. If that is not the case as is the situation with the present available test and truck data, time integrated states assuming zero-order holds during the transients need to be introduced into the model and the input-output model can be derived from the resulting state-space model.

The modelling approach involves following the evolution of the measurement signals at the input and the output of the
system. As the plug of fluid flows through the chamber, these measurements can be correlated based on the conservation
of moles within the fluid plug.
