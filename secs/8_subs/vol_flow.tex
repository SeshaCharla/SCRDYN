\subsection{Mass flow rate to volumetric flow rate}
The temperature dependent density of the exhaust gas is used to convert the mass
flow rate of the exhaust gas to the volumetric flow rate of the exhaust gas.
\begin{align}
    f_v &= \frac{F}{\rho} = \frac{FT}{\mu}
\end{align}

Thus, we have the residence time of the exhaust gas in the SCR-ASC system as:
\begin{align}
    \tau &= \frac{V}{f_v} = \frac{V \mu}{FT}
\end{align}
