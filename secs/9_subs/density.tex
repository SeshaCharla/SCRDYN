\subsection{Density of the exhaust gas}

The density of the exhaust flow is assumed to be the density of air at that
temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure. Using the ideal gas law:
\begin{align*}
    \rho &= \frac{PM}{R T} = \frac{\mu}{T}\\
    \text{where, } &\\
    p &= \text{Pressure of the exhaust gas (ambient pressure)} = 101.325 \: kPa\\
    M &= \text{Molecular weight of the exhaust gas} = 28.9652 \: g/mol\\
    T &= \text{Temperature of the exhaust gas in Kelvin}\\
    R &= \text{Universal gas constant} = 8.314 \: J/(mol.K)\\
\end{align*}
